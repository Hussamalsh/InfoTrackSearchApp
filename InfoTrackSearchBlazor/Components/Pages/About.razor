                        Every morning, the CEO of InfoTrack searches the keyword "land registry searches" in Google to see where and how many times their company, <a href="https://www.infotrack.co.uk" target="_blank">www.infotrack.co.uk</a>, sits on the list. This application automates that process, providing quick and accurate results to assist in improving SEO strategies and ultimately boosting sales.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The application allows users to:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Enter a search phrase and a URL to track its performance in search engine results.</li>
                        <li>View the ranking positions of the URL within the top 100 search results.</li>
                    </ul>
